# Reinforcement_learning


This project is about solving the random walk problem so that the agent can reach the "goal state" without paasing "trap states'. We perform value iterations to find vlues of state and action and use them to derive our policy based on envrionment dynamics and reward function.


## Prerequisites

* Python3 ValueIteration.py


## Usage>

```
python3 project4.py
```
